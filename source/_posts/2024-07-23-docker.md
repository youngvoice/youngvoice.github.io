In these days, when I upgrade the system to a high version, some build environments is changed. In this scenario, I can reinstall the operating systems, but there have many other envs and config file. So I make a VM based on VirtualBox, but I encounter filesystem problems frequently in these days. So I switch to docker. 

# The relationship between host environment and container

I need a container that have same environment with host as same as possible

# docker container

# docker images

# build docker image and run container

Dockerfile
```
# Use the official Ubuntu image as the base
FROM ubuntu:22.04

ARG USER_ID
ARG GROUP_ID
 
# Create a custom user with UID 1234 and GID 1234
RUN groupadd -g ${GROUP_ID} customgroup_name && \
    useradd -m -u ${USER_ID} -g customgroup_name customuser_name
 
# Switch to the custom user
USER customuser_name
 
# Set the workdir
WORKDIR /home/customuser_name
 
# Print the UID and GID
CMD sh -c "echo 'Inside Container:' && echo 'User: $(whoami) UID: $(id -u) GID: $(id -g)'"

```
```bash
docker build \
    --build-arg USER_ID=$(id -u ${USER}) \
    --build-arg GROUP_ID=$(id -g ${USER}) \
    -t target-image-name -f Dockerfile .
```

```bash
docker run --rm -itd \
    -v "/home/user_name/workspace:/home/user_name/workspace" \
    --volume="/etc/group:/etc/group:ro" \
    --volume="/etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro" \
    --volume="/etc/shadow:/etc/shadow:ro" \
    --network host \
    -u user_name \
    --privileged=true  user_name/ubuntu22.04:v6 /bin/bash

```

This means we share some init script and config
